# time_series

MACHBASE provides DURATION.

The main reason for using DURATION is to improve the performance even if a large amount of data is searched by reducing the search target.

**Syntax**
DURATION    time_expression [BEFORE time_expression | TO_DATE(time) ];  
DURATION    time_expression [AFTER TO_DATE(time)];  
time_expression  
-  ALL  
-  n   year  
-  n   month  
-  n   week  
-  n   day  
-  n   hour  
-  n   minute   
-  n   second
